In 1957, Dr. Nogier  developed a map of the ear based upon the inverted fetus concept, when he observed the occurrence of scars on the ears of a patient who were successfully treated for sciatic pain by French lay practitioners.  Auricular acupuncture is a treatment system based on normalizing the body's pain and dysfunction  through stimulation of points on the ear."}
