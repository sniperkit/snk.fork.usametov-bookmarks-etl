This Hexacopter frame is based off the ArduCopter 3DR quad. With two extra motors the lifting capacity is increased to over 1kg. The PDB still mounts neatly between the base plates but access to it is made easier by thumb nuts that easily unscrew to remove the stackup. This also lets you attach and remove APM with screws more easily."}
