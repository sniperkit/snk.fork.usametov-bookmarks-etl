Says: \"This cooker uses a circular curve rather than a parabolic curve, and a series of wedge-shaped pieces for the reflective surface rather than trying to mold a compound surface. This makes for easier construction, and most importantly, results in a 6-inch hot spot instead of a pinpoint for better cooking and more even heat. \""}
